<h1 align="center">Welcome to PyCrypt 👋</h1>
<p>
  <strong>Python Cryptography Project</strong>: A comprehensive collection of cryptography scripts implemented in Python.
</p>

## 📜 About The Project

PyCrypt is a collection of Python scripts that demonstrate various cryptographic techniques and algorithms, ranging from classical ciphers like the Caesar Cipher to more modern approaches. This project is designed to be a learning resource for those interested in the field of cryptography.

## 🚀 How to Use

To use any of the scripts in the PyCrypt collection, clone the repository and navigate to the desired script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gandli/PyCrypt.git
cd PyCrypt/scripts
```

For example, to run the `caesar_cipher.py` script:

```bash
python caesar_cipher.py [message] [key] [mode]
```

Replace `[message]`, `[key]`, and `[mode]` with your desired input. The `mode` can be 'encrypt' or 'decrypt'.

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.6 or later.
- Some scripts may require additional packages, listed in `requirements.txt`.

To install required packages:

```bash
# pipreqs scripts --encoding=utf8
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🧪 Running Tests

Ensure the reliability of the scripts with:

```bash
pytest
```
